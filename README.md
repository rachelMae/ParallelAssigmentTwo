   1. Method 1: Having guests randomly stop by would allow them to have more free time for the guests(threads) to do other things but they would waste time by coming by to check and not finding the room avaliable.
      It would be frustrating to keep looking in and not finding a time, on the other hand there may be no one visiting for a period of time if no one comes and checks.
   3. Method 2: The sign introduces a quick way for guests to check and still have free time. The same issue of if everyone comes at once there will be a huge crowd at the door exists.
   4. Method 3: I prefer and will implement this idea because it is the most fair and ordered. While the guests will have less freedom, they will choose when to enter the queue and will know exactly when to expect to be let in.
